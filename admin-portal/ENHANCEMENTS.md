# FIND Admin Portal Enhancements

This document outlines the enhancements made to the FIND Admin Portal to improve its functionality and user experience.

## 1. Recovery Detail Page with Map Visualization

A new recovery detail page has been added that allows administrators to:

- View detailed information about recovery requests
- Change the status of a recovery request (pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled)
- Visualize the delivery route on a map
- Track the progress of a delivery with a simulated delivery vehicle
- View shipping updates and estimated delivery dates

### Key Features:

- **Interactive Map**: Shows the origin (tracker location), destination, and current position of the delivery vehicle
- **Progress Visualization**: Displays the delivery progress with a progress bar and status indicators
- **Shipment Timeline**: Shows the history of the shipment with timestamps
- **Status Management**: Allows updating the status of the recovery request

## 2. Settings Page

A comprehensive settings page has been added to allow administrators to customize the FIND Admin Portal:

### Categories:

1. **Account Settings**:
   - Admin name, email, and phone
   - Password management
   - Profile image upload

2. **Notification Preferences**:
   - Email notifications toggle
   - Push notifications toggle
   - Alert emails toggle
   - Daily and weekly report settings

3. **Security Settings**:
   - Two-factor authentication
   - Session timeout configuration
   - Login history view

4. **System Configuration**:
   - Dark mode toggle
   - Language selection
   - Data retention period settings
   - Recovery polling interval

### Features:

- **Persistent Settings**: Settings are saved to localStorage (would be database in production)
- **Reset Functionality**: Option to reset all settings to default values
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices

## Implementation Notes

### Map Component

The Map component is a simulated visualization that:

- Shows a grid-based map with city blocks
- Displays markers for the tracker location, destination, and delivery vehicle
- Animates the delivery vehicle along a route
- Provides a simple but effective visualization of the delivery process

In a production environment, this would be integrated with a real mapping service like Google Maps, Mapbox, or OpenStreetMap.

### Settings Storage

The settings are currently stored in the browser's localStorage for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, these settings would be stored in your Supabase database and associated with the admin user's account.

## How to Use

### Recovery Visualization:

1. Create a tracker in the mobile app
2. Mark the tracker as "lost" using the method described in MARK_TRACKER_LOST.md
3. Go to the Recovery page in the admin portal
4. Create a new recovery request for the lost tracker
5. View the recovery request details
6. Click "Simulate Route" to visualize the delivery
7. Update the status to "Shipped" to see the shipping timeline

### Settings Page:

1. Access the settings page through the sidebar navigation
2. Modify settings in any of the four categories
3. Click "Save Changes" to persist your settings
4. Settings will be remembered across page refreshes

## Future Improvements

1. Integration with real mapping services for accurate tracking
2. Real-time updates using Supabase's real-time capabilities
3. Email notification system for status updates
4. Mobile app integration for delivery tracking
5. Analytics dashboard for recovery statistics
