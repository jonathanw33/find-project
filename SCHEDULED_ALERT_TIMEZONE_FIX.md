# Test Scheduled Alert Fix

## Issue Identified
Your scheduled alert was triggered at the wrong time due to timezone mismatch:

- **Your Alert**: Set for 13:08 (1:08 PM) local time
- **Actually Triggered**: 06:08 UTC (6:08 AM UTC) 
- **Your Timezone**: Appears to be UTC+7 (Indonesia/Bangkok)

## Root Cause
The original code was comparing local time directly with database time, but:
1. Supabase stores timestamps in UTC
2. The scheduled_time field was being stored in local format but compared incorrectly
3. The time comparison was too strict (exact match only)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Improved Time Matching**
- Added 1-minute tolerance window for triggering
- Better time parsing and comparison logic
- Added debugging logs to track what's happening

### 2. **Proper Local Time Handling**
- Uses local device time for scheduling decisions
- Compares scheduled time with current local time properly
- Maintains timezone consistency throughout the process

### 3. **Enhanced Debugging**
- Added console logs to track alert checking process
- Shows when alerts are found and why they trigger/don't trigger
- Helps identify timing issues

## How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Create a New Test Alert
1. Go to any tracker → Scheduled Alerts → Create Alert
2. Set it for 2-3 minutes from now
3. Watch the console logs for "Checking scheduled alerts at..."
4. Should trigger at the correct local time

### Option 2: Reactivate Your Existing Alert
Run this in your Supabase SQL editor:
```sql
UPDATE scheduled_alerts 
SET is_active = true, last_triggered = NULL 
WHERE id = '04845d59-e796-47d8-962a-64448ac7ca73';
```

Then change the scheduled_time to a few minutes from your current time:
```sql
UPDATE scheduled_alerts 
SET scheduled_time = '13:15:00'  -- or whatever time is 2-3 minutes from now
WHERE id = '04845d59-e796-47d8-962a-64448ac7ca73';
```

## Expected Behavior
- Alert should trigger at your **local time** (not UTC)
- Console will show: "Checking scheduled alerts at 13:15:00 on 2025-05-22"
- Alert will appear in your AlertsScreen
- Push notification will be shown (if available)

## Monitoring
Watch your console for these log messages:
- "Checking scheduled alerts at [time] on [date]"
- "Found X potentially matching scheduled alerts"  
- "Found X alerts to trigger"
- "Triggering alert: [title]"

The fix ensures that scheduled alerts respect your local timezone and trigger at the correct time you set them for.
